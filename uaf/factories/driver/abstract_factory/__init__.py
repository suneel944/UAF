"""
The Abstract Factory interface declares a set of methods that return
different abstract products. These products are called a family and are
related by a high-level theme or concept. Products of one family are usually
able to collaborate among themselves. A family of products may have several
variants, but the products of one variant are incompatible with products of
another.
